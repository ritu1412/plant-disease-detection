# Plant Disease Detection Using CNN

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting plant diseases through leaf image analysis. The goal is to accurately identify various plant diseases, aiding in effective plant healthcare and management.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises images of plant leaves affected by various diseases. Each image in the dataset is labeled with the corresponding disease, allowing the CNN model to learn and make predictions.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: The leaf images are preprocessed for optimal performance of the CNN model. This includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the dataset.
- **CNN Model**: The core of the project is the development of a CNN model. The model architecture, including the number of layers, activation functions, and other parameters, are optimized for accurate disease detection.
- **Training and Validation**: The model is trained and validated using the prepared dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

## Results
- The results section should include the performance metrics of your model, such as accuracy, and any other relevant findings from your analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, etc. (List given in requirements.txt)
